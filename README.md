**Editabled** is a modern, web-based platform built for engineering teams to create, document, and collaborate visually and technically—all in one place.

It combines a fast Markdown editor, real-time collaborative canvas, and diagram-as-code support to help teams think clearly, move quickly, and stay in sync. Whether you're designing architectures, writing technical specs, or planning workflows, Editabled provides the tools to turn ideas into systems.
